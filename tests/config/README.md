# Tests Configuration

This project organizes tests by sprint and feature area.

## Layout
- `tests/suites/sprint-1` - Cross-ticket tests validating Sprint 1 artifacts
- Unit/integration tests will be added next to implementation in future commits

## Running Tests
- Tests are currently documentation-driven. As code is added, use Jest for automated runs.
- Cross-ticket checks ensure required files/tickets/docs exist and remain consistent.
