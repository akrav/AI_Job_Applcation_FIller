### **Sprint 7 Overview: Frontend Development & UI/UX**

This sprint focuses on building the user-facing part of the application. We will create the UI components and pages for key user flows, including authentication, user profiles, and the core functionality for both agents and merchants. The goal is to provide a complete and intuitive interface that interacts with the backend APIs developed in previous sprints.

-----

### **Major Functionality Delivered**

  * **User Authentication UI**: Pages for user registration, login, and a profile dashboard.
  * **Merchant Interface**: A dashboard where merchants can manage their registered tools.
  * **Agent Interface**: A tool marketplace where agents can browse tools and initiate the application process.
  * **Memory Bank UI**: A dedicated page for users to manage their personal career data.
  * **API Integration**: All frontend components will be connected to the corresponding backend endpoints.

-----

### **Sprint Tickets**

The tickets are structured to build the core UI components first, followed by the more complex, role-specific pages.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Create User Authentication Pages (Login, Register) üîê
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-7001
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket covers the implementation of the core user authentication pages. It involves creating a simple, clean UI for users to sign up for a new account and log in to an existing one. These pages will connect directly to the `/api/v1/auth/register` and `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoints.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **UI Components**:
      * A login form with fields for `email` and `password`.
      * A registration form with fields for `email`, `password`, `name`, `dob`, and a dropdown for `account_type`.
  * **Functionality**:
      * Submit button that sends data to the correct backend API.
      * Display success or error messages to the user.
      * On successful login, store the returned JWT and redirect the user to their dashboard.
        \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * A **UI test** using a testing framework (e.g., Jest/Enzyme, React Testing Library) to verify that the forms render correctly.
  * An **integration test** that simulates a user filling out and submitting the forms, asserting that the correct API endpoints are called and the UI responds appropriately to success and error states.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * A new user can successfully register and is redirected to the login page.
  * An existing user can log in and is redirected to their respective dashboard.
  * Validation errors (e.g., missing fields) are displayed to the user without a network request.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Build User Dashboard and Profile Page üë§
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-7002
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket involves creating a generic dashboard that displays a user's basic information. It should be a protected page that fetches data from the `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint. The displayed content will be dynamic based on the user's role.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Component**: A `UserProfile` component that handles fetching and displaying user data.
  * **Logic**:
    1.  Use the stored JWT to make an authenticated request to the `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint.
    2.  Display the user's `name` and `account_type`.
    3.  Conditionally render `trust_rating` for merchants and `balance` for agents.
  * **Routing**: The dashboard route should be protected and only accessible with a valid JWT.
    \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * An **integration test** that simulates a successful API call to `/api/v1/users/me` and asserts that the correct user data is displayed.
  * A **UI test** that checks if the component correctly renders the merchant-specific data (e.g., `trust_rating`) when a mock merchant user is provided.
  * A **routing test** that asserts an unauthenticated user is redirected to the login page when trying to access the dashboard.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * A logged-in user is redirected to the dashboard.
  * The dashboard correctly displays the user's name and role-specific information.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Develop Merchant Tool Management Interface üõ†Ô∏è
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-7003
\<br\> **Description:** Create the UI for merchants to perform CRUD operations on their tools. This page will be the primary interface for merchants to manage their offerings on the platform. It will connect to the `TICKET-6004` endpoints.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Component**: A `MerchantTools` page that displays a list of the merchant's tools.
  * **Functionality**:
    1.  A button to create a new tool, which opens a modal or navigates to a form.
    2.  Display a list of existing tools, with buttons to "Edit" or "Delete" each one.
    3.  A form for creating/editing a tool with all the required fields (name, description, pricing, etc.).
  * **API Integration**: Use the `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints from `TICKET-6004`.
    \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * An **integration test** that mocks the backend API and asserts that a merchant can see a list of their tools.
  * A **UI test** that verifies the form for creating a new tool contains all the necessary input fields.
  * An **interaction test** that simulates a click on the "Delete" button and asserts a confirmation dialog appears before the API call is made.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * A merchant can view a list of their registered tools.
  * The merchant can successfully create, edit, and delete their tools through the UI.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Build Agent Tool Marketplace & Application UI üõí
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-7004
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket focuses on creating the UI for agents to browse and use tools. This is the core functionality for the agent user type. It will integrate with the endpoints from `TICKET-5003` and `TICKET-5005`.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Component**: An `AgentMarketplace` page.
  * **Functionality**:
    1.  Display a list of all available tools, fetched from the `/api/v1/tools` endpoint.
    2.  Each tool listing should have a "Use this Tool" button.
    3.  Clicking the button opens a form or modal for the agent to provide `context` and select their `writing_style` and `memory_bank` entry.
    4.  The form's submission will trigger a call to the `/api/v1/apply` endpoint.
        \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * An **integration test** that mocks the backend API for listing tools and asserts that the UI correctly displays the list.
  * A **UI test** that verifies the application form contains the required input fields and dropdowns.
  * An **interaction test** that simulates the entire flow: selecting a tool, filling out the form, and submitting it. It should assert the API call is made with the correct payload.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Agents can browse all public tools in the marketplace.
  * An agent can select a tool and initiate the application process through the UI.
  * The agent's balance is displayed and updates correctly after a successful transaction.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Create Memory Bank Management Interface üìö
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-7005
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket is for the UI that allows a user to manage their personal Memory Bank. The page will enable them to create, read, update, and delete their data snippets, which are used to train the AI. It will connect to the `TICKET-5002` endpoints.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Component**: A `MemoryBank` page.
  * **Functionality**:
    1.  Display a list of the user's existing memory bank entries.
    2.  A form or modal to add a new entry with `title` and `content` fields.
    3.  Buttons to "Edit" or "Delete" each existing entry.
  * **API Integration**: Use the `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints from `TICKET-5002`.
    \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * An **integration test** that mocks the backend and asserts the page displays the list of entries correctly.
  * A **UI test** that validates the form for adding a new entry.
  * An **interaction test** that verifies that when a user adds a new entry, the UI updates to show the new entry in the list without a page refresh.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Users can view a list of their memory bank entries.
  * Users can successfully create, edit, and delete their entries.
  * The UI provides real-time feedback on successful and failed operations.
