### **Sprint 8 Overview: CI/CD, Containerization, & Production Deployment**

This sprint's purpose is to prepare the entire application for a production environment. We will package our backend and frontend services into Docker containers and configure a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment. This establishes a robust, repeatable process for delivering new features and fixes to a production environment.

-----

### **Major Functionality Delivered**

  * **Dockerized Services**: The Node.js backend and React frontend will be containerized.
  * **Database Containerization**: The PostgreSQL database will be configured to run in a Docker container for consistent local development and testing.
  * **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**: A basic pipeline will be configured to automatically run tests and build the Docker images upon code changes.
  * **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts will be created to deploy the application to a cloud-based server.
  * **Secure Environment Variable Management**: A secure system for managing environment variables for different deployment stages (e.g., development, staging, production) will be implemented.

-----

### **Sprint Tickets**

The tickets are ordered to build on each other, starting with the foundational containerization and moving up to the final deployment pipeline.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Dockerize the Node.js Backend Service üê≥
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-8001
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket covers creating a **Dockerfile** for our backend application. Containerizing the application ensures it runs consistently across different environments, which is essential for a reliable CI/CD pipeline.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Dockerfile**: Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the backend service.
  * **Instructions**: The Dockerfile should:
    1.  Use a slim Node.js base image.
    2.  Copy `package.json` and install dependencies.
    3.  Copy the application code.
    4.  Expose the port the Express server runs on.
    5.  Define the command to start the application.
        \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * A **build test** that asserts the Docker image builds successfully.
  * A **run test** that starts the container and asserts the application is running and accessible on the exposed port.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * A Docker image of the backend service can be built successfully.
  * The container can be run and serves a basic endpoint without crashing.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Testing ‚úÖ
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-8002
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket focuses on setting up a basic Continuous Integration pipeline. This pipeline will automatically run our test suite whenever new code is pushed, providing immediate feedback and preventing regressions.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **CI/CD Tool**: Use GitHub Actions or a similar service.
  * **Pipeline Steps**: The pipeline must include the following stages:
    1.  **Checkout**: Fetch the latest code from the repository.
    2.  **Install Dependencies**: Install Node.js packages.
    3.  **Run Tests**: Execute the full test suite for the backend service.
        \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * A **pull request test** that asserts the CI pipeline runs successfully on a pull request.
  * A **failure test** that intentionally introduces a failing test and asserts the CI pipeline correctly reports a failure.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * The CI pipeline is triggered automatically on new commits to a specified branch.
  * All backend unit and integration tests run successfully in the pipeline.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Implement Production Environment Variable Management üîê
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-8003
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket involves creating a secure method for managing sensitive environment variables in our production environment. Hard-coding secrets is a major security risk, so we need a robust solution.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Mechanism**: Use the built-in secret management features of the chosen CI/CD and cloud platforms (e.g., GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager).
  * **Variables**: Securely store at least the following:
      * `DATABASE_URL`
      * `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
      * `LLM_API_KEY`
        \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * A **secret access test** that a test script successfully retrieves a stored secret from the environment without exposing it in the logs.
  * A **failure test** that attempts to access a non-existent secret, asserting a specific error or `undefined` value is returned.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Sensitive data is stored securely and is not committed to the repository.
  * The application can access the correct environment variables during deployment.

-----

**Ticket Name:** Create Deployment Scripts for Production üöÄ
\<br\> **Ticket Number:** TICKET-8004
\<br\> **Description:** This ticket focuses on writing the scripts needed to deploy our application to a cloud server. This is the final step in getting the application live.
\<br\> **Requirements/Other docs:**

  * **Scripts**: Create shell scripts (or a `Makefile`) to automate the following:
    1.  Building the production-ready Docker image.
    2.  Pushing the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
    3.  Connecting to the remote server via SSH.
    4.  Pulling the latest image and starting the container.
        \<br\> **Test Suite Design:**
  * A **script execution test** that a deployment script is run successfully in a simulated environment.
  * A **service check test** that after a deployment, an automated script checks a health endpoint (`GET /api/v1/health`) and asserts a `200 OK` response.
    \<br\> **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * The deployment scripts can be run from the command line without manual intervention.
  * The application is successfully deployed to a staging environment and is accessible via a URL.
