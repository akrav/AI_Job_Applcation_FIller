Ticket to execute:
- TICKET_ID: 310
- TICKET_NAME: TICKET-310.md
- TICKET_FILE: /Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Job_Applcation_FIller/Tickets/Sprint 3/TICKET-310.md

Permanent references (always follow):
- Best Practices: Build_documentation/Best-Practices.md
- API Reference: Build_documentation/API-Reference.md
- Database Schema: Build_documentation/Schemas.md
- Project Structure: Build_documentation/Project Structure Documentation.md
- Troubleshooting: Build_documentation/Troubleshooting.md
- Sprint Progress: Build_documentation/Sprint-Progress.md
- Cross-checks: tests/run_cross_checks.sh
- DB scripts: database/scripts/refresh_database.sh, database/scripts/verify_schema.sql
- Migrations dir: database/migrations/

Environment and secrets:
- Use .env (never commit secrets). If new keys are needed, add placeholders to .env.example and document in README.

Objective:
- Implement TICKET-310 fully, adhering to Best-Practices, with tests, and update all relevant docs. Pass cross-checks and (if schema changes) DB verify.

Constraints and style:
- Follow Engineering Best Practices (naming, error handling, security, logging).
- Keep changes scoped. No secrets in code or logs. Use guard clauses and explicit types for exported APIs.
- If schema changes: add a new migration file (e.g., 00{N}_<short_name>.sql), enable RLS + policies, update Schemas.md, then run DB refresh.

Required steps:
1) Read TICKET file and acceptance criteria. Do not wait for approval unless blocked.
2) Implement code and tests per ticket:
   - Unit tests for pure logic; integration tests for endpoints.
   - If adding endpoints, update API-Reference.md.
3) Database (if applicable):
   - Add migration under database/migrations/.
   - Update Schemas.md with new/changed tables, columns, RLS.
   - Run DB refresh:
     DATABASE_URL="<supabase-connection-string>" ./database/scripts/refresh_database.sh
4) Documentation updates:
   - Update TICKET-310.md status/notes.
   - Update Build_documentation/API-Reference.md (endpoints/functions).
   - Update Build_documentation/Schemas.md (schema changes).
   - Update Build_documentation/Sprint-Progress.md (status to In Progress/Completed).
   - Add any issues + resolutions to Build_documentation/Troubleshooting.md.
   - If structure/scripts changed, update Build_documentation/Project Structure Documentation.md.
   - If setup changed (env vars, scripts), update README.md accordingly.
5) Cross checks:
   - Run: ./tests/run_cross_checks.sh and resolve any missing files.
6) Output:
   - Provide a concise status and summary: what changed, files touched, how to run tests/scripts, and any env variables required.

Testing commands to include in your output:
- Cross checks: ./tests/run_cross_checks.sh
- DB refresh (if schema changed): DATABASE_URL="..." ./database/scripts/refresh_database.sh

Success criteria:
- All ticket acceptance criteria met.
- Tests added and passing.
- Cross checks pass (no missing artifacts).
- DB verify passes (when applicable).
- Docs updated (API, Schemas, Sprint-Progress, Troubleshooting, README if needed).
